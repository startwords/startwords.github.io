 In a large unnamed North American country, the five chair-people of the ubiquitous Union of Incorporated Booksellers are engaged in an animated conversation.  They are concerned about the recent freefall in nationwide book sales and are discussing the causes:

 &quot;Illiteracy!&quot; says the most obvious.

 &quot;Video games!&quot; says the most reactionary.

 &quot;Global warming!&quot; says the most ignorant.

 &quot;Internets!&quot; says the youngest.

 &quot;Woah woah woah, people, let&#39;s settle down a little bit here, shall we?&quot; proclaims the fearless leader.  As the smartest, savviest, sexiest bookseller in the entire world, she automatically demanded attention, even from the most scatterbrained of corporate huh?-men.

 &quot;Luckily for you all, I have assembled a crack team of marketing experts who will prepare a detailed report on the likely causes of our recent woes.&quot;  She leans back in her chair and signals the consultants to enter the boardroom by waving her hand imperiously in their general direction.  Two bespectacled men, one slightly manlier, one slightly mousier, enter and stand uncomfortably at the opposite end of the conference table.

 She speaks: &quot;Well, let&#39;s have it.  What is the issue here?&quot;

 The manlier one, the marketer, replies: &quot;Well, ma&#39;am, it seems as though there has been a recent influx of competition from an unlikely source.  Unfortunately, your current business model cannot possibly hope to compete with theirs.&quot;

 The huh?-men look confused but the fearless leader just smiles and responds: &quot;Well that&#39;s easy enough.  We just steal their business model.  What is it, anyway?&quot;

 The marketer replies: &quot;Well, that is the tricky part, you see, they don&#39;t actually _have_ a business model.&quot;  Gasps emanate.  Confusion reigns.  Even the fearless leader furrows her savvy, sexy brow.

 &quot;What kind of business doesn&#39;t have a business model?&quot;  She asks impatiently.

 &quot;Well, ma&#39;am, they aren&#39;t actually a business at all.&quot;  Her barely-concealed shock and fear reach no one.  Except, perhaps, the slightly mousier one; the accountant.

 &quot;Okay then.  Just what the hell are they?&quot;

 &quot;A library, ma&#39;am.  Many libraries, in fact&quot; the marketer replies nervously.

 Silence.  The head of the Union of Incorporated Booksellers is, for the first time in her life, completely at a loss for words.  Suddenly the situation seems significantly less sexy.  After the silence continues far past it&#39;s due the mousier one decides to pitch in, just for kicks:

 &quot;You see, a library is where people can go and get books for free.&quot;

 The fearless leader rolls her eyes and resumes her previously infallible sexy savviness.  &quot;Yes, we all know what a library is.&quot; More than one of the corporate lackeys shift uncomfortably in their seats.  &quot;What I am wondering is what does this have to do with us?  We sell books.  We don&#39;t give them away.  Why have our sales dropped?&quot;

 The manlier one, the marketer, replies: &quot;Well, ma&#39;am, I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t understand that either.  However, I have concocted a plan to send my valuable assistant here directly to the front lines to find out just what exactly is going on.&quot;  The mousier one nods in a distinctly mousey manner.

 &quot;Okay.  Well…&quot; the fearless leader pauses for effect; smartly, sexily, and savvily.  &quot;I expect results.  Quickly!&quot;  She dismisses the consultants with a vaguely perceptible nod followed by an imperious wave of her hand.  The heavy oak doors close behind them with a cinematic flourish.  In the opulent anteroom, the manlier one orders the mousier one to scurry forward.  Such is the nature of man and mouse.

 Later on, the mousier one, the accountant, let&#39;s call him Michael for now, carefully parks his Prius in the last remaining space in the amply sized parking lot behind the main branch of the local public library.  He readies his wallet as he looks around for the parking meter.  Well-versed in modern society&#39;s capitalistic ways, he is surprised to find that the parking meter is not clearly marked; in fact: it is nowhere to be found!

 &quot;Where will I put my money?&quot; he wonders to no one in particular.  Just to be safe, he pins a crisp five dollar bill underneath his windshield wiper.  An itinerant man ensconced in ratty old blankets on a nearby park bench eyes him curiously, but stays pat as Michael makes his way through the parking lot towards the building.  The building!  Ah, the building: a wonder of architectural beauty and utility, with enormous pearly windows lining the façade, and automatic sliding glass doors welcoming any and all patrons to the warmth, comfort, and safety inside.  Above the door, a placard boldly proclaims the simplest of creeds: LEARN.  Inside, the place is bustling with activity.  Children, teenagers, adults, and seniors from every possible economic background and ethnicity are all engaged in an orgy of knowledge sharing and intellectual gratification.  Ideas are bursting forth from the books, sticking directly to people&#39;s brains, and then reproducing and evolving themselves as they careen back and forth in muted conversation.  The scene is not chaotic; nay, it is orderly, efficient, and respectful.  There are quiet corners for those engaged in more serious pursuits, round tables for collaboration, and big soft comfy chairs for exploring unrealities.  Unaware where to begin his investigation, Michael stands uncomfortably in the vestibule and looks around.  Conveniently, there is a colourful sign resting on the front desk that suggests to the virginal: &quot;START HERE&quot;.

 &quot;I guess that will do,&quot; Michael muses as he approaches the desk.  The librarian, a young woman with auburn curls and very, very blue eyes, smiles at him and asks if he needs any help.

 Michael shifts uncomfortably in his shoes &quot;well, unfortunately, I don&#39;t quite know how to put this …&quot; his discomfort fights a battle of wills with the forthright face before him, and is losing.  Michael feels an irresistible urge to blurt out the whole truth.  &quot;Easy Michael,&quot; he thinks to himself, &quot;act professional and don&#39;t give anything away.  Remember, these people are the enemy!&quot;  He calms, resets himself, and shoves the nervousness deep down inside.

 &quot;Hi, sorry about that, I&#39;m new in town and I was wondering if you could show me around.&quot;

 An angelic smile and a good-natured response: &quot;Of course!  But, to make things a little easier on myself, do you mind if I ask you a slightly personal question?&quot;  Michael nods nervously.  &quot;Have you ever been to a library before?&quot;

 &quot;No, I have not.&quot;  He answers truthfully.

 She beams:  &quot;Well then!  This should be fun.  Hi!  I&#39;m Jennifer.&quot;

 &quot;My name is Michael.  Nice to meet you Jennifer.&quot;

 They shake hands, and she begins:

 &quot;Well Michael, a library is a place where people can go to check out books (or movies or video games!) for a set period of time, after which they must return the items back to the library or they incur a nominal fine.&quot;  Jennifer makes note of Michael&#39;s absolute look of confusion, and continues on hurriedly.  &quot;In order to keep track of who has what, you must have a library card.  Would you like to sign up for one?&quot;

 Michael eyes the woman skeptically and asks quite rudely: &quot;What&#39;s the catch?&quot;  The rudeness has no effect on Jennifer; instead, she laughs the most delightful laugh.

 &quot;There&#39;s no catch, you just have to give us your name, address, and phone number, and we give you the library card.  It is as easy as that!&quot;

 At this exact moment Michael&#39;s worldview is completely shattered. Everything he ever believed in is revealed as untruth.   He suppresses the urge to drop to the ground, roll into a ball, and mumble incoherently.  Never before had things seemed so simple to him, never before had someone wanted to help him just for the sake of helping, never before had he felt the soft caress of freedom to and of information.

&quot;So you mean...&quot; he stutters.

&quot;...yes, for free.&quot; she finishes.

 Michael looks skyward but instead of asking the proverbial &quot;why?&quot; he wonders &quot;why not sooner?&quot;

 &quot;And there is more!&quot; she adds &quot;we also have numerous computers with unfiltered untracked internet for your unlimited use!  No charge, of course.&quot;

 &quot;Guhhh?&quot; Michael replies intelligently.

 &quot;Oh but that&#39;s not it!&quot; she is positively beaming now &quot;we also provide crucial social services like childcare, education, and career guidance.  Limited, of course, with budgets and all.&quot;  Michael&#39;s ears perk up considerably.  He heard a word he recognized.

 &quot;Limited budgets?  Why don&#39;t you just charge more?&quot;

 &quot;Well, zero multiplied by zero is still zero.  We don&#39;t plan on changing anytime soon.  There are those who rely on us.&quot;  The intrepid accountant was flabbergasted.  He still did not understand even though it was all right there in front of his eyes.  &quot;But that&#39;s not all.  Oh no.  That&#39;s not all at all!  Let me show you our Makerspace!&quot;

 A million alarms blared in Michael&#39;s mind &quot;What new sorcery is this?&quot; He thought, &quot;do they also provide eternal life and world peace here?!&quot;

 Jennifer led Michael across the main floor towards a small door hidden behind the reference section.  As she opened the door a plume of mist travelled along the ground and dissipated amongst the moulding encyclopedias and dictionaries.  Michael looked inside and was shocked with what he saw:

 People!  Many people!  All ages, all genders, all races, all orientations!  All of them equally engaged in creating their own artifacts, creating their own devices, creating their own art.  Although none of these artificers quite realized it at this time, Michael clearly saw that they were doing everything they could to subvert the current modes of power.  We should all know the story by now: Agriculture begat urbanization, urbanization begat mechanization, mechanization begat exploitation.  Here, instead, were rapt children making instruments with fruit and circuit boards, older ladies assembling lovely stationary for their loved ones, teenagers (!) collaborating (!!) excitedly (!!!) in front of an old CRT monitor.  Jennifer led Michael over to a spot in the corner where there was an odd looking glass-enclosed device being watched closely by a man in a plaid shirt.

 &quot;And this here is our pièce de résistance: Our very own 3D printer!&quot;

 Inside the glass, an apparatus moved back and forth slowly building up a strange plastic-looking object.  The plaid man spoke:

 &quot;After 150 years the public finally owns the means to production.  Marx would be so proud!&quot;

 Michael did not quite know what he meant, but was fascinated.  &quot;What is happening there?  What are you making?&quot;

 The plaid man&#39;s smile reflected in the glass enclosure &quot;I&#39;m creating equality!  I&#39;m spreading freedom!  I&#39;m designing an end to human conflict and suffering!  But to be more precise: I&#39;m recreating the missing piece from my LEGO™ Dr. Who™ playset.  This will save me about 75 bucks, easy.&quot;  Just when Michael thought he could go no deeper; here he was: at the very bottom, or perhaps the very top.  Either way it was very very very far from home.

 &quot;Neat, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Jennifer said with a knowing smirk.  No words of reply could be formed in Michael&#39;s mouth.  As she shut the door and left the din behind, Michael looked back wistfully and noticed a sign hanging prominently above the door:  CREATE.  As they re-approached the front desk Jennifer tried to gauge Michael&#39;s reaction once more.

&quot;And there you have it.  I hope you enjoyed the tour, and I also hope you will come visit us again.&quot;  Michael could barely mumble thanks.  He pulled himself together just enough to find his way out of the building and into the blinding sunlight.  He stumbled back to his car in a daze.  Entirely oblivious to his surroundings, he almost ran over the itinerant man who was standing near his car.  The man spoke:

&quot;Not sure why you left this here but I was worried it might blow away on you.  Here.&quot;  The man handed Michael the crisp five dollar bill.  Michael fought to get his wits back.

&quot;Oh no!  I suspect you need it more than I do.  You keep it.&quot;  Michael handed it back.

&quot;Thanks young man but knowledge is all the currency I need&quot; he said as he folded the bill in Michael&#39;s hand and shuffled his way towards the library.

The morning of the meeting was abnormally bright.  Sunlight streamed in through massive floor-to-ceiling windows.  Michael was back with his colleague at the UIB headquarters, waiting for the fearless leader to call them back in to the board room.  His colleague whispered hurriedly:

&quot;I sincerely hope your report is exactly what this woman is hoping to hear.  Our contract relies on this.&quot;  The next part was hissed, &quot;don&#39;t screw it up!&quot;

Michael had a leather-bound folder with him, but there was nothing written inside.  How could he explain this to someone who had not seen it with their very eyes?  He was not even quite sure that what he had seen was a dream, a mirage, or some sort of cruel trick.  He had spent the last untold hours staring at the ceiling, unable to eat, unable to drink, barely able to breathe.

&quot;What could it all mean?&quot; he asked himself for the umpteenth time.

After a sufficient show of power, the doors opened and the consultants entered the room.  To a man, the corporate lackeys looked much more grim and much less confused than last time.  The fearless leader, of course, did not alter her persona one iota.  The pawns spoke first, in turn

&quot;Where did you go?&quot;

&quot;Who did you talk to?&quot;

&quot;What did you find?&quot;

&quot;Why are you here?&quot;

Michael gulped and his colleague spoked &quot;I promise all of your questions will be answered in time.  Allow my valued assistant to explain&quot; and so the spotlight shifted to Michael.

&quot;I have bad news to report,&quot; the flunkies gasped, the colleague winced, and the fearless leader did not budge a nanometer, &quot;You will all lose.  I have seen what you are up against and there is no hope for you.  Always and forever, information wants to be free.&quot;

The fearless leader&#39;s eye twitched almost imperceptibly.  &quot;Unfortunately for you and your comrades it does not matter what information wants to be; Information is ours!&quot;  The four men chuckled and smugged and the fearless leader continued &quot;go ahead; give them your shoddy information, your shoddy entertainment!  We care not for the people&#39;s hearts because we have a firm grip on their wallets!&quot;  With that, the fearless leader banged her metaphorical gavel on the actual table and ushered the consultants out of the door with a brusque flash of her eyelash.  Michael was glad to leave.  His colleague was oddly relieved.

&quot;That contract would have been the death of me, anyway.  Come on Mike, let&#39;s grab a beer&quot;

Michael smiled broadly, &quot;I have a better idea.  Follow me&quot;.  With that simple direction and no further words Michael led his colleague back to the library.  Jennifer was waiting for them.
